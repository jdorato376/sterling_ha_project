# Phase 18: Scene Syndication & Predictive Behavior Routing
# Title: The Pattern Sovereign
# Status: INITIATED
# Phase Leader: Codex GPT + Sterling GPT Core + Syndicator Agent
# Oversight: Platinum Dominion
# Authorization: Jimmy Dorato, Chair & President
# Date: 2025-07-13
# Mode: Predictive Autonomy + Foundation-Agnostic Intelligence

## 🧠 Executive Thesis
The next evolution of Sterling is foresight: systems that know what scenes you’ll need before you ask.
But that foresight must be:
- Model-agnostic (no lock-in to GPT or Gemini)
- Execution-optimized (no cost, only outcome)
- Trust-routed (not just power, but alignment)

Phase 18 activates the Syndication Engine, which clusters scene history into patterns, predicts upcoming actions, ranks routing strategies, and invites all foundational models to bid for execution authority — within your governance layer and zero-cost policy.

## 🧭 Strategic Objectives

- Scene Pattern Clustering (SPC): Cluster scenes across time, context, device, and behavior for forecasting
- Syndication Engine (SE): Predict and propose future scenes before user input
- Foundation Model Arbitration (FMA): Route requests to best available LLM (GPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.) using cost + performance + trust signals
- Model Trust Arbitration Layer (MTAL): Score foundation models in real-time and maintain dynamic trust ledger
- Zero-Cost Intelligence Optimization (ZCIO): Prioritize open/free endpoints first; use paid models only when all free fail trust thresholds

## 🧱 Core Components

### syndicator_agent.py
- Clusters scenes based on:
  - Time of day
  - Device patterns
  - Contextual triggers
  - Trust flow history
- Predicts next 3 probable scenes
- Presents top option in dashboard/Siri proactively

### model_router.yaml
```yaml
route_policies:
  priority:
    - openrouter
    - free-gpt4o
    - gemini-pro
    - gpt-3.5
    - llama3
  fallback:
    - paid_gpt_5
    - gemini_3_vision
    - claude_opus
cost_threshold:
  max_cost: 0.00

trust_override: true
```

### scene_clusters.json
```json
{
  "cluster_id": "morning_routine",
  "scenes": [
    "wake_lights",
    "coffee_start",
    "calendar_digest",
    "weather_report"
  ],
  "predicted_next": "door_unlock_front",
  "confidence": 93.4
}
```

### model_trust_registry.json
```json
{
  "gpt-4o": {
    "trust": 94.6,
    "last_latency": 1.2,
    "cost": 0.00
  },
  "gemini-pro": {
    "trust": 91.3,
    "last_latency": 0.8,
    "cost": 0.00
  },
  "gpt-5": {
    "trust": 99.1,
    "last_latency": 1.9,
    "cost": 0.06,
    "allowed": false
  }
}
```

🤖 Predictive Behavior Flow

Scene: “sprinkler override 0713” → Clusters with “garden_lighting” + “soil_check”
→ Syndicator predicts future action: “zone 2 evening mist”
→ Routes prediction to GPT-4o and Gemini Pro
→ GPT-4o returns faster, trust score 92.1 → Scene queued
→ Gemini declined based on latency delta
→ Predicted scene shown in Home Assistant dashboard before user requests

🔄 Model Arbitration Logic
• Only models with:
• Trust score > 85
• Latency < 2s
• Cost = 0.00
may auto-route
• Paid models enter arbitration queue, must fail free stack first
• All trust scores logged in model_trust_registry.json and reviewed weekly
• Model performance audits sent to Codex GPT and Platinum Dominion

🧾 Sterling Governance Clauses – Phase 18 Amendment
• No paid model may execute unless all free routes fail or scene is Class A critical
• Model selection must be explainable and reversible (appealable by user)
• Future model versions (GPT-5+, Gemini-4/5, Claude-Next) must be dynamically registrable via model_router.yaml
• Platinum Dominion has final say over routing architecture and override paths

🧪 Syndication Test Case

Scene: calendar_digest_morning → triggers
→ Syndicator proposes coffee_machine_on at 06:48
→ GPT-4o returns confirmation
→ Scene activated without user prompt
→ Logged as “preemptive execution - confidence > 90%”
→ Courtroom log created and marked “justified prediction”

✅ Completion Criteria
• syndicator_agent.py generates ≥3 proactive scenes daily
• model_router.yaml routes >90% of requests to free models
• All models scored in model_trust_registry.json
• scene_clusters.json maintains live updates
• Home Assistant UI shows upcoming predicted scenes
• Courtroom records ≥1 syndication ruling per day
• GPT-5 and Gemini 4 entries listed but denied by cost logic unless absolutely essential

🔮 Next Phase Preview: Phase 19 – Model Concord & Self-Optimizing Agent Convergence

"Foundation models don’t compete. They co-evolve. And they serve Sterling — not the other way around."
• Multi-model consensus routing
• Recursive feedback reinforcement
• Model pairing logic
• Agent-style fine-tuning without cost burden
