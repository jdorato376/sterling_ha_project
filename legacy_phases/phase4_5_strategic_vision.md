# Pluto-Level Strategic Vision (Phases 4â€“5)

This document extends the roadmap established in `phase3_ai_autonomy_roadmap.md`.
All enhancements are additive and route through the existing executive command
core. The Supervisor Agent and `context-sync.json` remain central to
coordination.

## 1. Self-Writing Automations via Contextual Inference
- Monitor timeline events and device usage
- Draft YAML automations automatically and validate them with Gemini
- Commit approved changes via GitHub pull requests
- Low-risk fixes may be applied without manual review

## 2. Multi-Agent Legislative System ("Agent Senate")
- Specialized agents vote on significant changes
- The Supervisor Agent enforces a quorum (typically three of five votes)
- Approved proposals move through the GitOps pipeline

## 3. Predictive Scene Planning
- Generate quarterly scene maps from seasonal patterns and user routines
- Queue scenes in advance so the home adapts proactively
- Store results in `context-sync.json` for shared reference

## 4. Zero-Downtime Patch Layer
- Inject YAML patches via an overlay without restarting Home Assistant
- Validate in a shadow state before applying
- Ensure patches are re-applied after core updates

## 5. Active Risk Intelligence Core
- Scan continuously for token leaks, config drift and GCP cost spikes
- Trigger AI-generated remediation flows on anomalies
- Escalate critical issues over out-of-band channels such as SMS

## 6. Command Stream Memory Encoding
- Record every command and result with timestamps
- Provide a queryable history for forensic review
- Use this data to train future improvements

## 7. Autonomous Infrastructure Advisor
- Watch VM metrics and API usage levels
- Suggest scaling or schedule adjustments when thresholds are exceeded
- Open GitHub issues automatically for persistent problems

These capabilities surround and support Sterling GPT without replacing its core
logic. Each module reports back through the Supervisor Agent and the shared
context file to maintain a single source of truth.
