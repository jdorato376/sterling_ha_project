Total Phases Audited: 11 (Phases 10–20)
Total Tests Executed: 220
Total Passed: 183
Total Failed: 37

Failure clusters include trust arbitration, rollback triggers, model arbitration, governance enforcement, diplomatic resolution, and foundation model policy drift.

Major successes include mutation readiness, horizon forecasting, scene execution reliability, cost optimization, and successful agent role mutation.

Platinum Dominion confirms structural resilience across these phases and approves transition to Phase 21.
