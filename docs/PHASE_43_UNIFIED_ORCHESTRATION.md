# ðŸ§  Sterling OS â€” Phase 43 Unified Orchestration

Phase 43 connects the Siri-first and Copilot-first assistants to deliver a single voice orchestration layer.
It prepares daily executive summaries and routes commands to the appropriate persona.

## Key Components
- `phase_43_siri_copilot_initializer.py` â€“ bootstraps the unified voice router
- `SiriCopilotVoiceOrchestrator` â€“ dispatches commands across Siri and Copilot
- `generate_executive_summary` â€“ produces a daily summary from news sources

Use the initializer to launch the orchestration layer after configuring trust settings.
