# Project Sterling: Pluto-Class Autonomy Stack

This document outlines the long-term plan for extending Sterling GPT and Home Assistant OS into a fully autonomous, cloud-native control plane. It summarizes the "Pluto-Class" roadmap provided by the executive team.

## üß† Core Objectives
- **Enhance** the existing assistant with modular agents rather than replacing it.
- **Deploy** Codex GPT as an orchestration overlay for CI/CD and feedback loops.
- **Implement** Home Assistant OS on Google Cloud as the executive control plane.
- **Bridge** local and cloud AI models (Gemini, OpenAI, Mistral, Ollama) via the Assist API and other hooks.
- **Expand** into multi-agent orchestration using CrewAI, LangChain, and Gemini agents while preserving privacy-first policies.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Phase Highlights
1. **Foundation** ‚Äì HAOS is already deployed on GCP with static IP and GitHub repo for configuration.
2. **Enhancement Layer** ‚Äì Keep the current agent architecture and add Codex GPT for modular improvements.
3. **AI Autonomy** ‚Äì Introduce specialized agents (`energy.py`, `health.py`, `routines.py`, `security.py`) and a crewAI bridge for real-time collaboration.
4. **GitHub Autonomy** ‚Äì Automate configuration checks, nightly backups, and self-healing hooks via GitHub Actions.
5. **Cloud Instrumentation** ‚Äì Use `gcp_ops.py` and monitoring scripts to manage VM scaling and OS updates via Supervisor API.
6. **Timeline & Apple Integration** ‚Äì Sync with Apple Calendar, Siri shortcuts, and provide a Lovelace dashboard for milestone tracking.

## ü™ê Pluto-Level Strategic Goals
```json
{
  "interplanetary_delay_simulation": true,
  "redundant_agent_networks": true,
  "zero-trust-multiagent": true,
  "biometric_voiceprint_auth": "future",
  "context-window-anchoring": "live",
  "regenerative_scene_ai": "next-gen",
  "eventual_goal": "fully autonomous executive brain, Earth-independent"
}
```

These goals provide a north star for ongoing development. Each phase should be implemented incrementally, ensuring that existing functionality remains stable while new capabilities are introduced.
