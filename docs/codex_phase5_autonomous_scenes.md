# Codex GPT Phase 5: Multi-Agent Arbitration & Autonomous Scene Evolution

Phase 5 brings a strategic layer to Sterling OS. Multiple micro-agents can now propose actions which are then arbitrated through a simple voting system. Scene deltas are tracked to detect deviations and Sterling can suggest new automations based on observed patterns.

## Key Modules
- `agent_orchestrator.py` – weighs agent responses by trust score and context.
- `scene_delta_tracker.py` – logs differences between current and expected scenes.
- `natural_scene_composer.py` – converts natural language preferences into YAML scenes.
- `sterling_suggestions.py` – surfaces proactive automation tips.

These modules enable Sterling to evolve scenes over time while preserving human oversight.
